# Go dependencies.  For each of the listed tools it is possible to override the
# default version and Go repository by also specifying "version" and "source" as
# additional dict members alongside "name".  Note that the listed tools are
# essential, so ensure to keep them if you're overriding and/or extending here.
#
# For example,
#
#  - {name: "litewitness", version: "v0.3.0", source: "example.org/torchwood"}
#
# would result in "go install example.org/torchwood/cmd/litewitness@v0.3.0".
