Releases are made in the form of git tags.  There is no fixed release cycle.  In
other words, releases are made whenever something new becomes ready.  Please
refer to the repository's NEWS file to learn about what changed in each release.

--- Tagging conventions
The git tags in this repository are formatted as

  vX[.Y][-rcZ]

where X, Y, and Z are monotonically increasing counters.  Point releases (.Y)
are used for bug fixing and other minor updates.  Release candidates (-rcZ) are
used to facilitate testing of a release.  A few example tags are shown below.

  v1
  v1-rc1
  v1.1
  v1.1-rc1
  v1.1-rc2
  v1.2
  v1.2-rc1
  v2
  v2-rc1

---Quality assurance
Quality is assured by using the molecule testing framework for testing on the
platforms listed in the ansible-galaxy metadata file, see meta/main.yml.  To
catch obvious errors, ansible-lint and yamllint are also enforced by our CI.

Before cutting a release, the most recent release candidate is used for
deployment on a system that runs Debian bookworm.  This manual test includes
ensuring that a witness backend is able to connect and use the bastion host.
