# TLS configuration. This allows the certificate to be externally managed using
# any challenge method (e.g., DNS-01). Note: this is mutually exclusive with
# ACME.

# ACME configuration. This requires litebastion to be accessible on port 443 so
# it can respond to the TLS-ALPN-01 validation requests from Let's Encrypt.
# Note: it only needs to be accessible on port 443, so it is perfectly valid to
# listen on a different port and redirect to it.
