NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.6.0

	Changes between v1.5.0 and v1.6.0:

	* Bump default version of torchwood for litewitness and
          litebastion from v0.7.0 to v0.9.0. All users should upgrade
          to v0.9.0 due to bugs in earlier versions of witnessctl and
          litebastion.

	* Added support for per-log bastions.

	* Added support for periodically pulling logs to witness from
          a centrally managed list (e.g.,
          https://testing.witness-network.org/log-list.1).

	* Added support for using externally managed TLS certificates
          for litebastion.  This is useful when using challenge
          methods other than TLS-ALPN-01, such as DNS-01.

	* Added support for litewitness -no-listen flag, which
          prevents litewitness from opening any listening
          sockets. This should only be used when relying solely on
          per-log bastions.

	* Deprecated the variables litewitness_sigsum_log_keys and
          litewitness_vkey_log_keys in favor of litewitness_logs.  The
          old variables will remain supported for now but will be
          removed in a future release.

	* Deprecated the variables litebastion_host and
          litebastion_email in favor of litebastion_acme_host and
          litebastion_acme_email.  The old variables will remain
          supported for now but will be removed in a future release.

	* Removed the litebastion_h2v variable as the corresponding
          flag was removed in litebastion v0.4.0.

	* Moved molecule tests to extensions directory.

	* Fixed various warnings in molecule tests.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.5.0

	Changes between v1.4.0 and v1.5.0:

	* Support for monitoring the presence of a YubiHSM device with
          a particular serial number was added.

	* Refactoring regarding lists of go tools in sigsum and
          litewitness roles, avoiding problems when running ansible in
          debian trixie.

	* Fix in when clause in golang and yubihsm_connector roles,
          avoiding problems when running ansible in debian trixie.

	* Changed naming of cronjob for weekly public suffix list
          update, to handle the special case when primary and
          secondary are on the same machine.

	* Cleanup and fixes in molecule tests.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.4.0

	Changes between v1.3.0 and v1.4.0:

	* The sigsum role had its cronjob for weekly refreshing of the
          public suffix list changed to make it work also for the
          secondary node.

	* galaxy.yml was updated to clarify that this repo contains
          roles for not only transparency logs but also for witnesses.

	* The version of sigsum-agent used by default changed from
          v0.2.3 to v0.2.5.

	* A bug was fixed where a sigsum-agent using a YubiHSM wouldn't start
	  if it was being started before the yubihsm-connector was properly
	  ready (#73).

	* A bug making log lines from sigsum-agent not show up in the
          journal was fixed (#72).

	* Restarting the agent service was fixed, making restarts made
          by Ansible work well too (#70).

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.3.0

	This release adds a litebastion role in roles/litebastion
	based on the https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/litebastion
	repository which has now been archived.

	Changes:

	* Merged litebastion repo into roles/litebastion/ directory.

	* Added molecule test scenario for litebastion.

	* Changed the name litetlog to the new name of that repo which
          is torchwood. (https://github.com/FiloSottile/litetlog
          renamed to https://github.com/FiloSottile/torchwood) Using
          torchwood v0.5.0 for both litewitness and litebastion.

	* Changes to allow primary and secondary running on same
          machine. This involves the possibility of using different
          filenames for the config file and the tree-id file for
          primary and secondary, but the default filenames are the
          same as before so the change is backwards-compatible.

	* Added brief documentation in mariadb role.

	* Removed unused docs/ and renamed CHANGELOG.rst to NEWS.

	* Changes to automatically restart log after weekly
          suffix-list update.

	* Made it possible to run several litewitness instances in
          parallel.

	* Added support for non-sigsum logs in litewitness role.

	* Cleanup and fixes to avoid red output from molecule tests.

	* Changed debian repo url from ftp.acc.umu.se to
          deb.debian.org.

	* Bumped community.mysql version from 3.6.0 to 3.12.0

	* Moved away from legacy /var/run to /run for
          sigsum-agent.socket file. See
          https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05s13.html

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.2.0

	This release adds support for deployment of transparency-log
	witnesses.  For further details, refer to the README in
	roles/litewitness.

	Changes:

	* A litewitness role has been added, along with corresponding
	  molecule tests.

	* Generated systemd unit files are now placed under
	  /etc/systemd instead of under /lib as it was before. The new
	  location /etc/systemd has higher priority than the old
	  location (see man systemd.unit), so users do not need to
	  change anything.

	* In the litewitness role, set RestartSec=1m in the .service
	  file. This should help avoid giving up too early due to
	  start rate limiting, and also avoid too frequent error
	  messages.

	Bug fixes:

	* A problem with dependencies after reboot was solved by
	  setting dependencies in the sigsum-agent .service file
	  instead of in the .socket file. This fix regards the
	  sigsum_agent role.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.1.3

	This is a bug-fix only release.

	Bug fixes:

	* The sigsum_agent service now starts properly after a system
	  reboot and the log services wait for it to do so.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.1.2

	This is a bug-fix only release.

	Bug fixes:

	* The runtime directory for sigsum_agent is now being created
	  by systemd rather than by Ansible, fixing #22. sigsum_agent
	  units are now being run by the system instance.

	* Tests are no longer dependent on
          ansible.builtin.openssh_keypair.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.1.1

	This is a bug-fix only release.

	Bug fixes:

	* The dynamic handler names in the sigsum_agent role were not
	  functioning on some systems (tasks failed).  Now static
	  handler names are used instead.  This means it is not yet
	  supported to configure more than one sigsum-agent per play.

	* The sigsum role did not work when omitting the MYSQL root
	  password.  This has now been fixed by using a UNIX socket
	  instead of the default host and port.

	* Most configuration changes (like adding a witness or
	  changing Trillian's logging verbosity) did not result in the
	  appropriate service restarts.  This has now been improved
	  while keeping the sigsum role idempotent if there are no
	  changes.

	* The MariaDB backup scripts kept failing once they'd started
	  to fail in a particular way. This has now been fixed.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.1.0

	This release adds support for accessing private keys using the
	ssh-agent protocol.  See the new sigsum-agent role for further
	details on how to use the ssh-agent protocol for process
	separation and private keys backed by YubiHSMs.

	This release also adds support for rate-limit configurations.
	It is off by default, but can be enabled by setting
	sigsum_allowlist_limit >= 0.  See also the related settings
	sigsum_allowlist_keys and sigsum_allowlist_domains.

	This release comes with some internal refactoring and includes
	bug fixing.  Most notably, the log will no longer restart
	every time the sigsum role runs.  A few variables have been
	dropped in the process of refactoring, but no breakage is
	expected.  See the detailed notes if you want to clean-up your
	sigsum variables.

	Documentation and testing have been improved.  There are now
	molecule tests that also serve as examples of how to configure
	a primary-secondary log pair as well as a stand-alone primary
	that uses the sigsum-agent role and ssh-agent protocol.

	Debian bullseye has reached end of life.  We now target Debian
	bookworm systems.

	Detailed notes:

	The target environment for running molecule tests have been
	changed to podman.  Instructions for running the tests have
	been migrated and improved, see HACKING.

	The distribution that our roles and tests target have been
	updated from Debian bullseye to Debian bookworm.  Debian
	bullseye may work but is not tested by us.

	A role that installs and configures sigsum-agent has been
	added, see roles/sigsum_agent.  For overview, sigsum-agent is
	a tiny ssh-agent signing oracle that works with two backends:
	unencrypted key-file and YubiHSM.  Use of this role is
	optional, i.e., the sigsum role has only been *extended* to
	work with configurations that access private keys using the
	ssh-agent protocol.  A related role for installing the YubiHSM
	connector has been added, see details in
	roles/yubihsm_connector.  Use of roles/yubihsm_connector is
	also optional.

	Git-clone checkouts of Go tooling (sigsum-go, log-go, and
	Trillian) have been deprecated.  The required tools are
	installed directly using Go's tooling.  No action is needed by
	existing users, but these variables are now ignored:

	* sigsum_trillian_srcdir (this directory can be deleted on the target host)
	* sigsum_trillian_repo
	* sigsum_lib_srcdir (this directory can be deleted on the target host)
	* sigsum_lib_repo
	* sigsum_log_srcdir (this directory can be deleted on the target host)
	* sigsum_log_repo

	The sigsum role is more idempotent now.  This fixes a bug
	where the Sigsum log servers would restart every time the role
	runs, causing unnecessary downtime.

	Diretories and files for the sigsum user are now configured
	with user-only permissions.  For example, directory
	permissions were changed from 0755 to 0700.

	Documentation of the sigsum role's default variables have been
	improved significantly.  You are encouraged to take a look in
	defaults/main.yml.

	An option to tune Trillian's log verbosity has been added:

	* sigsum_trillian_verbosity

	The default is WARNING.  This fixes a nit where the system's
	journal got spammed with INFO output.

	Configuration of rate-limits have been added.  The relevant variables are:

	* sigsum_allowlist_limit
	* sigsum_allowlist_keys
	* sigsum_allowlist_domains

	To enable rate limits (off by default), set
	sigsum_allowlist_limit >= 0.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.0.4

	Bumped default log-go version from v0.14.0 to v0.14.1.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.0.3

	Bumped default sigsum-go version from v0.3.4 to v0.6.1.

	Bumped default log-go version v0.12.0 to v0.14.0.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.0.2

	Bumped default trillian version from v1.5.1 to v1.5.2.

	Bumped default sigsum-lib-go version from v0.1.23 to v0.3.4.

	Bumped default sigsum-log-go version from v0.9.0 to v0.12.0.

	Added ``sigsum_witness_config`` option to the
	``sigsum.ansible.sigsum`` role to enable witness configuration
	for the primary node.

	Removed the ``sigsum_sth_file`` and
	``sigsum_trillian_tree_id_file`` options. The directory
	component of these were not being used, only the filename
	component. These filenames are now fixed values (``sth`` and
	``tree-id``).

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.0.1

	Added ``no_log`` options to the ``sigsum.ansible.mariadb``
	role to hide passwords from showing in the ansible log output.

NEWS for sigsum ansible v1.0.0

	This is the first major release of the ``sigsum.ansible``
	collection. Going forward releases will be versioned according
	to `SEMVER <https://semver.org/>`_

	Breaking Changes:

	* The ``tree-id`` file in deployed installations needs to have
          ``tree-id=`` prepended the value in the file. If this file
          is not updated the log will fail to start.

	* This can be done by locating the installation path (usually
          under ``/var/sigsum``), finding the ``tree-id`` files and
          running the below code or similar.

	  	  $ echo "tree-id=$(cat tree-id)" > tree-id

	Changes:

	* ``sigsum_key`` now assumes a string with a OpenSSH formated
          key is passed. The old variable is preserved with
          ``sigsum_key_file``.

	* ``sigsum_secondary_pubkey`` now assumes a string with an
            OpenSSH formated public key. The old variable is preserved
            with ``sigsum_secondary_pubkey_file``.

	* Rename the following variables

	* ``sigsum_rate_limit_config`` to ``sigsum_rate_limit_file``

	* New variables

  	* ``sigsum_backend`` to specify the sigsum backend. Currently only takes ``trillian`` as a value.

	* ``sigsum_key_file`` takes a file location for the Sigsum key.

	* ``sigsum_secondary_pubkey_file`` takes a file location for the public key of the secondary node.

	* Removed variables

	* ``sigsum_tree_id`` - internal implementation detail

	* ``sigsum_ephemeral_test_backend``

	Minor Changes:

	* Dependency updates:

	* ``log-go`` updated to ``v0.9.0``

	* ``sigsum-go`` updated to ``v.0.1.23``
