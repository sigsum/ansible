We test that a primary-secondary log pair can be deployed, including end-to-end
tests like submitting checksums, requesting proofs, and verifying that these
proofs are OK.  We also check that the secondary is actually
replicating, by verifying expected tree size.

We also do a primary-only test that makes use of the new ssh-agent things.
